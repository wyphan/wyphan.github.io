Last week (Friday, October 8, 2021) I gave a talk at the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)](https://www.nersc.gov/), titled "Journey Towards Exascale Computing". The talk is roughly divided into three parts:

* My High Performance Computing (HPC) background
* A recap of current trends in HPC from the past 20 years
* Suggestions for [Perlmutter supercomputer](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/), which is a pre-exascale machine at NERSC
