नमस्ते! (Namaste!)

As the first international contributor outside the Indian subcontinent, it is an honor to be featured on the "Open Source Cafe" podcast being produced by [DeCodeCafe Community][decodecafe]. I'd like to thank [Vyom Yadav][vyom] for hosting the podcast and [Rahul Khinchi][rahul] for inviting me to it!

We covered a range of topics, including, but not limited to, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) as one of the oldest and most influential open-source organizations, the Fortran programming language, a brief introduction to the current landscape of supercomputing, and compiler technologies. I tried to keep it as engaging and beginner-friendly as possible by not diving too deeply into the technical details of the Fortran _DO CONCURRENT_ parallel loop execution construct. I also discussed some of the significant milestones in my life that have led me to where I am today, such as my first computer (a used Toshiba Satellite from Akihabara) and my first programming language (Fortran 90).

Anyway, I encourage you to check out the [full playlist for the podcast][yt] to see what open-source software is about -- the variety of topics covered, the lasting impact of the movement, tried-and-true tips and tricks for beginners, and so on. If you just want to see my podcast appearance for brevity, it's Episode 9 and the title is "Contributing to GCC".
