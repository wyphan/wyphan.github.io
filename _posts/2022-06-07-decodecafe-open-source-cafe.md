नमस्ते! (Namaste!)

Today I am honored to feature in the "Open Source Cafe" podcast by [DeCodeCafe Community][decodecafe] as the first international contributor outside the Indian subcontinent. Big thanks to [Vyom Yadav][vyom] for hosting and [Rahul Khinchi][rahul] for inviting me to the podcast!

We covered various topics, including, but not limited to: the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) as one of the oldest and most important open source organization, the Fortran programming language, a brief introduction into the current landscape of supercomputing, and compiler technology. I think I consciously decided not to dive deep into technical territory about the Fortran `DO CONCURRENT` parallel loop execution construct to keep it as engaging and as beginner-friendly as possible. I also covered some colorful moments in my personal journey that brought me to where I currently stand in life, such as my first computer (a used Toshiba Satellite from Akihabara) and my first serious programming language (Fortran 90).

Anyway, I encourage y'all to check the [full playlist for the podcast][yt] to see the wonderful world of open-source software -- the variety of topics covered, the lasting impact of the movement, tested tips and tricks for beginners, and so on. If you just wanna see my podcast appearance for brevity, it's Episode 9 and the title is "Contributing to GCC".
