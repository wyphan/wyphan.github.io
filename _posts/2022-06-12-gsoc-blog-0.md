This weekend marks the end of the community bonding period for GSoC '22, and here’s my progress so far with the GSoC project on Fortran `DO CONCURRENT`.

I've initialized a [GCC mirror on GitHub][mirror] where I plan to track all patches that I will create during the GSoC:

I met with Tobias Burnus, one of my mentors, over a MS Teams call on May 30, 2022. Together, we picked GCC [PR# 102003][bug] as a good starter issue to start delving into the Fortran parser in GCC. He also guided me through how to debug the compiler using gdb. Tobias, thanks a lot for spending some of your (technically) vacation time with me!

In the meantime, I’ve implemented a simple build script system for GCC that I christen `GCCprefab`. Before this build system existed, there are only two relatively easy ways to build GCC painlessly:

1. Using [Spack package manager][spack]: `spack install gcc'
2. Using the install script for [OpenCoarrays][caf]

The name pays homage to **prefab**ricated buildings such as sheds/barns (even sections of houses) that are commonly sold in the US at hardware stores such as Home Depot or Lowe’s. It’s arguably an overengineered solution to my laziness having to memorize all the different configure flags when building GCC from sources.

Right now, GCCprefab has the following features:

- One single script written in Bash
- One single argument: a config file written in a custom format inspired by [Spack spec syntax][spec] and the Windows INI / [TOML][toml] format for configuration file
- Clones the main GCC Git repo, or a custom mirror of your choice
- Upon execution, logs standard output for each phase of the build process into a timestamped log file, which is xz-compressed after each phase completes successfully
- Licensed under the permissive, FSF-compatible [Apache 2.0 license][apache]

To try it out, you can head over to [my GitHub repo][gh].

Please feel free to open an issue there if you found a bug or would like to suggest new features. Pull requests are welcome too! Also, you can also jump in anytime to the [discussion thread][forum] at the Fortran-lang Discourse forums.
