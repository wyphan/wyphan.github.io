Just a lowly, scatterbrained research software engineer / computational physicist, trying to dive deep into the world of high-performance scientific computing. A natural polyglot, both in human languages and programming languages.

If you're into social media, send me a friend request at my (rarely updated) [Facebook page][fb] or [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]. Please note that I vet my friend requests and usually only accept requests from people that I actually know in real life or whose interests align deeply with mine. I am not on Twitter or Instagram. I am sometimes on [Reddit][reddit] and Discord but my sense of humor is pretty dark, so please "handle with care".
